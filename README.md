Samaritan
=========

<b>You're being watched.</b> The administrators have a system—a machine—that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because I built it.

Samaritan is a plugin that watches your players and determines if they're griefing or breaking other rules—even abusing staff members. Using intelligent tools for chat and in-game actions. It also comes stock with several commands that can be used to moderate and deal with situations quickly--without leaving a trace. In fact, Samaritan is able to completely hide its presence from standard members so they aren't as careful.
